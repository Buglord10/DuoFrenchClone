# Product Blueprint: **Élan Français**

## 1) Product Vision

**Élan Français** is a mobile-first, gamified French learning platform designed for long-term progression from beginner to near-native proficiency (CEFR A1 to C2). The product combines short, high-frequency lessons with deep skill scaffolding, adaptive review, and competitive social loops.

### Core goals
- Make daily French practice habitual through streaks, reminders, and low-friction lesson sessions.
- Provide a very large curriculum (hundreds of lessons) to sustain multi-year learning.
- Balance motivation (score, leagues, badges) with pedagogical rigor (CEFR alignment, mastery gates, spaced repetition).
- Deliver an original visual and tonal identity while using proven gamified UX patterns.

---

## 2) UX & Experience Design (Mobile-First, Path-Based)

## UI principles
- **Clean and playful:** rounded cards, simple iconography, high contrast, minimal cognitive load.
- **One main action per screen:** continue lesson path, start review, claim reward.
- **Progress path map:** section-based route with nodes (lessons), grouped by units.
- **Micro-interactions:** haptics, celebratory animations, subtle sound cues.
- **Accessible defaults:** dyslexia-friendly font option, subtitle support for audio, colorblind-safe palette.

## Primary navigation
1. **Learn** (course path)
2. **Practice** (targeted review + mistakes)
3. **Leagues** (weekly leaderboard)
4. **Profile** (French Score stats, streaks, badges)
5. **Shop** (streak freezes, boosters, cosmetics)

## Screen set
- Onboarding + placement check
- Home path (current unit + daily goal)
- Lesson player
- Unit checkpoint/test
- Review hub
- League table
- Streak calendar
- Badge gallery
- Subscription/paywall (non-intrusive)

---

## 3) Curriculum Architecture

## Hierarchy
- **Section = CEFR Level** (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2)
- **Unit = thematic + grammar bundle**
- **Lesson = 5–12 exercises, 3–7 minutes**

## Course scale target
- **Total units:** 96
- **Average lessons per unit:** 10–14
- **Total lessons:** ~1,080
- **Checkpoint tests:** 96 (1 per unit)
- **Section mastery tests:** 6 (1 per CEFR section)

This volume supports multiple years of progression and long-term retention loops.

## 5) Skill Progression Logic

## Skill tracks
- **Grammar:** introduces forms, then applies in communicative contexts.
- **Vocabulary:** thematic clusters + frequency-based core lexicon.
- **Listening:** word recognition → sentence parsing → authentic speed audio.
- **Speaking:** repetition → prompted production → free response.
- **Reading:** sentence comprehension → paragraph inference → complex texts.
- **Writing:** controlled typing → guided composition → independent arguments.

## Progression model
- Each lesson tags 1–3 primary skills.
- Skills have **Mastery Levels 0–5**:
  - 0 New
  - 1 Introduced
  - 2 Practicing
  - 3 Functional
  - 4 Strong
  - 5 Mastered
- Unit completion requires average mastery ≥3.0 across unit skills.
- Section unlock requires:
  - completion of all units
  - passing section mastery test (≥75%)
  - no core grammar skill below level 2

## Adaptive difficulty
- Real-time adaptation by error type:
  - lexical confusion → more meaning-matching items
  - agreement errors → targeted grammar drills
  - listening misses → slowed audio + replay prompts
- Session difficulty score dynamically adjusts item complexity and distractor similarity.

---

## 6) Lesson Format Design

## Standard lesson composition (5–12 tasks)
1. Warm-up recall (easy confidence item)
2. New concept intro (micro explanation)
3. Guided practice (2–4 tasks)
4. Mixed reinforcement (2–4 tasks)
5. Productive challenge (typing/speaking)
6. Recap + score summary

## Exercise types
- Multiple choice (meaning/form)
- Tap-to-complete sentence
- Match pairs (word ↔ meaning, phrase ↔ audio)
- Reorder tokens
- Dictation (listen + type)
- Free typing translation
- Speak the sentence (ASR scoring)
- Listen and choose transcript
- Conversation simulation (branching response)
- Error correction (find and fix)
- Short reading + comprehension question

## Checkpoints
- **Unit checkpoint:** cumulative mixed skills.
- **Section exam:** timed, multi-skill, weighted scoring.

---

## 7) Review & Spaced Repetition

## Memory model
- Every skill item has a **stability score** and **difficulty score**.
- Review scheduling (SM-2 inspired variant):
  - Strong correct → next review in 4–10 days
  - Hesitant correct → 1–3 days
  - Incorrect → same day / next day

## Review surfaces
- Daily “Weak Skills” queue
- “Mistakes Notebook” auto-generated from wrong answers
- “Rapid Review” 2-minute sessions
- Pre-checkpoint mandatory review if error rate >35%

## Reinforcement rules
- Previously weak items appear as warm-up in new lessons.
- Streak users receive one bonus review chest after 7 consecutive days.

---

## 8) Gamification System

## French Score (FS) system
French Score is the universal progression currency.

## Base FS earnings

## 15) Database Schema Outline

## Core tables (simplified)
- `users(id, email, locale, created_at, premium_status)`
- `profiles(user_id, display_name, avatar, current_section, current_unit, french_score_total)`
- `sections(id, cefr_level, order_index)`
- `units(id, section_id, title, order_index, unlock_rule_json)`
- `lessons(id, unit_id, title, difficulty, estimated_minutes)`
- `exercises(id, lesson_id, type, prompt_json, answer_json, skill_tags)`
- `user_lesson_attempts(id, user_id, lesson_id, score_pct, fs_earned, mistakes, completed_at)`
- `user_skill_mastery(user_id, skill_code, mastery_level, stability, last_reviewed_at)`
- `review_queue(user_id, exercise_id, due_at, priority)`
- `streaks(user_id, current_streak, longest_streak, freezes_available, last_goal_met_date)`
- `daily_goals(user_id, goal_fs, updated_at)`
- `league_weeks(id, week_start, week_end)`

## 16) French Score Tracking Logic

## Event-based FS pipeline
1. Lesson engine emits completion event.
2. Scoring service calculates base FS.
3. Applies modifiers (streak multiplier, bonus, premium boosts if any).
4. Validates anti-abuse rules.
5. Persists in `user_lesson_attempts` and increments `profiles.french_score_total`.
6. Emits `fs_awarded` event for leaderboard and analytics consumers.

## Pseudologic
- `fs_final = floor((fs_base + fs_bonus) * fs_multiplier)`
- `fs_final = min(fs_final, daily_cap_rule(user_id, content_type))`

---

## 17) Leaderboard Update Logic

## Near-real-time flow
- Redis sorted sets store weekly cohort FS totals.
- On `fs_awarded`, increment user score in cohort set.
- Recompute ranks for affected neighborhood only (rank window optimization).
- Persist periodic snapshots to PostgreSQL every 5 minutes.
- Final weekly reconciliation job computes official rank, promotion, relegation, rewards.

## Resilience
- Idempotent event handling via event IDs.
- Dead-letter queue for failed updates.
- Reconciliation job to correct cache/DB drift.

---

## 18) Monetization Model (Optional)

## Free tier
- Full core curriculum access with pacing limits on advanced practice sessions.
- Ads between certain lesson completions.
- Limited streak freeze capacity.

## Premium tier
- Ad-free learning
- Unlimited hearts/errors or generous fail buffer
- Advanced insights dashboard (skill heatmap, pronunciation trends)
- Extra streak freezes and bonus challenges
- Offline lesson packs
- Priority in new content beta access

## Ad model
- Rewarded video for optional boosts/freezes.
- Interstitials at controlled frequency caps.
- No ads during active exercise flow to preserve learning quality.

## Subscription structure
- Monthly and annual plans.
- Regional pricing support.
- Intro trial window with clear renewal UX.

---

---

## 20) Success Metrics (KPIs)

- Streak length distribution
- Section completion rates and drop-off points
- Time-to-complete by CEFR level
- FS earned per active user/week
